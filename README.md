# Crop-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts crop prices using linear regression. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the future prices of various crops based on historical data. The model can help farmers, traders, and policymakers make informed decisions by anticipating price trends.
